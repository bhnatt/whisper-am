      "['I am the ascended master, Gautama Buddha. What does the Buddha have to do with the cross and taking someone down from the cross? Well, you do not really believe, do you, that people were not crucified in their minds before Jesus appeared on earth?', 'The symbols that we have explained during this conference about the deeper meaning of the cross, of course applied before Jesus, it has applied for as long as people on earth have gone into duality.', 'So, when I was preparing my mission, as the Buddha, my mission to teach, I had to take myself down from the cross many times.', 'I grew up in a very protected environment. In a palace, I had very specific other conditions, never saw all the sick people, had all the material goods and pleasures I could possibly want.', 'I was crucified by that very worldly, pleasurable, comfortable lifestyle. I had to take myself down from the cross several times before I was actually ready to leave that palace and go out into the forest and live like an acidic, meditating, almost stabbing myself to death.', 'And as I was sitting there meditating, I was, of course, examining my own mind and I overcame certain illusions and meaning again that I took myself down from another cross, because as we have explained, you can, in a certain way say that for each of the 144 levels of consciousness, there is an illusion that keeps you tied to the cross.', 'So, I came to the point where I could take myself down from a big cross, a big illusion and realize that the acidic lifestyle was too extreme and therefore was not the ultimate way.', \"That is when I discovered the middle way, but even then I still have to go through a process that isn't really recorded in the Buddhist scriptures where I qualified myself to begin my teaching mission and that was again taking myself down from a series of crosses.\", \"But then I started my teaching mission and the Buddhists, most Buddhists would like me to think that by then I certainly was a perfected being, many Buddhists want to think that I was perfected from the beginning, so I didn't have to go through a process, but this cannot be supported by a basic examination of my life story.\", 'So, even after I started teaching, I still had illusions to overcome, for a simple reason that if I had overcome all illusions, I could not have held on to a physical body.', 'So, I still had to see things in myself, overcome self itself, take myself down from these crosses.', 'What I am simply saying here is that I have gone through the process of descending from the cross and therefore I am qualified to speak about the topic.', 'So what can we say as another way to look at the cross?', 'Well, as others have said, therefore there will some matter for arms or ends of the cross, for points of the cross, and so you are crucified in matter.', 'But what is matter?', 'Matter can be set to be form.', 'You live in a world of form.', 'You live in a world of form that you have not personally created.', 'We have explained that when you first descend into embodiment in an unassembled sphere, you are co-creator.', 'You see yourself as a connected being, and you see that you are in an environment that has been created by beings with a higher level of consciousness than you.', 'So, you are using your connection to co-create, and you know you are not creating by your own power.', 'Therefore, in that situation, but you have not gone into duality, you are not crucified by matter.', 'Because you know that you are more than formed.', 'You are even more than the self that you have taken on.', 'In this unassembled sphere, even when you first take embodiment, you do have follower bodies.', 'You have an identity, mental, emotional and physical body.', 'And in order to start co-creating, you are creating structures in those emotional mental and identity bodies.', 'This happens as you, from the level of your eye and presence, descend through the 144th,', '143rd and down to the 48th level in your particular sphere.', 'So, in a sense, you are taking on these solutions, but since you still see yourself as a connected being, you are not crucified in your own mind.', 'And therefore, when you create some physical circumstance, you are not identified with your own creation.', 'Therefore, you are not identified by the matter creation you have brought forth, and you still see yourself identified with the physical body.', \"So, it's only when you go below that 48th level, go into the realm of separation that you become crucified.\", \"But, didn't I just say that, for each of the levels, even above the 48th level, there is an illusion you have to overcome, and therefore, you are in a sense crucified by that illusion.\", 'So, I might not now say in the opposite.', \"No, because I'm not talking about the same situation.\", 'When you first descended, it was not on a planet that had duality.', 'Even the original inhabitants of yours, first took embodiment when nobody on Earth had got into duality.', 'But when you take embodiment on a planet like Earth, where the consciousness has been so infused by duality, that is when you can then say that,', 'you are crucified by each of these illusions, because it really is only when you are at the 144th level, that you fully overcome the sense that matter matters.', \"It's not just that you are physically or emotionally or mentally trapped or crucified or fixated, but you still have a sense that conditions in matter matter.\", \"It's not necessarily that you are identified with them, as you begin to go about the 96th level, you stop identifying yourself with matter.\", 'But you still think that there is something that matters on Earth, something that you would like to see changed.', 'And on a planet as densest Earth, you maintain that till the very end.', 'You saw Jesus hanging on the cross, and he still had some desire to do something on Earth, to carry on his mission,', 'and therefore he wanted God to save him from the cross so that he could continue his mission.', 'And that was still that sense that matter matters, something in matter matters.', 'You can, even though this is not recorded in the scriptures, look at my teaching mission.', 'I was not identified with the body, I was not identified with matter, but I still had to sense that something in matter matter,', \"that's why I stayed on Earth and was teaching.\"] ... ['And it might seem sophisticated from a certain viewpoint, but it can never become permanent.', 'For eternal life can be achieved only through Christ, only through reuniting with the Buddha nature, overcoming all illusions that you could ever be separated from the Buddha nature, all illusion that form that any form could be separated from the Buddha nature and could be other than the Buddha nature.', 'This is the basic illusion that we have talked about with the duality consciousness.', 'The basic illusion is there is the Buddha nature, there is Christ and there is something that is other.', 'It is not the Buddha nature, it is other than the Buddha nature separated from the Buddha nature.', 'This is the basic illusion of duality that the world can be divided into two.', 'But the division into two cannot be real, the Buddha nature cannot be divided.', 'Only in the illusions of Maya can you create the appearance that they are two.', 'Therefore, the idea that there is a God and a devil is an illusion and the God that you see from this state of consciousness is not the real God, not the formless God.', \"We say formless because you cannot put words on God's consciousness.\", 'God is completely beyond the forms that you can see from an understanding sphere.', 'So the world is not two, it is not divided, it is one.', 'It was always one.', 'But what can motivate a being who has been trapped in the illusions of Maya to strive to overcome the illusions of Maya?', 'Why did I as the Buddha talk about Nirvana?', 'Because you have to motivate people to walk this path of overcoming all of these cells they have based on illusions.', 'Sure, these people are suffering and they want to escape suffering.', 'But when you are trapped in the consciousness that creates suffering, you cannot see how to create, how to escape suffering.', 'You think that perhaps you can destroy the condition that creates suffering, perhaps you can create better conditions out of the consciousness of separation, but it cannot be done.', 'You can never escape suffering through the consciousness of separation.', 'But neither can you really grasp what it means to be outside the consciousness of separation.', 'So therefore, we as spiritual teachers, we have to give people some motivation for starting the path of escaping separation that they can grasp and that appeals to them while they are still in separation.', 'That is why I formulated the first noble truth, life is suffering, but there is a way out of suffering and it is the aid for a path.', 'But what would motivate people? Yes, it can motivate you to get away from suffering, but what are you getting into?', 'People will ask and people did ask.', 'When I walked the aid for a path, what is the end goal?', \"What's the payoff out in the end?\", 'Well, that is why I formulated the concept of Nirvana as an alternative to suffering, to the sea of some sorrow.', 'Yet, not that I had this concept in my mind, but what did people do when they heard this concept?', 'They projected a mental image upon Nirvana based on the illusions of separation.', 'And now they were thinking that the purpose for walking the aidful path was to reach this dualistic image of Nirvana.', 'That is why there is a teaching in the Buddhist scriptures that you come to a point where you realize that Nirvana and some sorrow are basically the same thing or out of the same substance, because they are both out of the illusion of separation.', 'And therefore, they both need to be destroyed before you are free, before you are liberated.', 'And this is the fallacy of many religions on earth, including the Christian religion, the Jewish religion, the Judea Christian tradition.', 'It is again, as we have said, when you go into duality, you start creating a God in the image and likeness of the separate self, even the fallen beings.', 'And so you are using the conditions in form in an unassended sphere, on an unnatural planet, to put yet what it is like in the spiritual realm.', 'And you cannot, thereby, know what it is like in the spiritual realm.', 'We are sent at Masters, we are in the spiritual realm, we can ever give you a teaching about certain conditions in the spiritual realm.', 'But we are in no way trying to give you the full view of this, because we know it cannot be grasped, and there is no point in you even knowing what it is like in the spiritual realm.', 'Because we have also explained what you do when you go into this linear separate mind, you are seeing yourself as a subject studying a remote object.', 'And this is the same with the ascended realm, when you are in an unassended sphere, when you are unassended, you are studying the ascended realm as a separate object.', 'This can be necessary for you to gain a certain understanding on the mechanics of the ascension process, which is why we give this.', 'But you have to recognize here that no matter how sophisticated or an understanding, you think you have of the ascended realm, you are not in the ascended realm, and you will not bring you there.', 'You will get there only by letting go of this mental image, the separate self, and then when you are there, you are experiencing the ascended realm.', 'At least from the level of consciousness you have when you ascend, you are not experienced the fullness, as I have said, many levels up to the Creator.', 'So, once again, I have given you a big mouthful, many things to ponder, but I know that some of you will understand, some of you will be willing to ponder it, and use these teachings we have given to take yourself down from the cross of your previous understanding of the spiritual path.', 'No, out of description of the path can take you to the ascended state, only by transcending all outer descriptions, can you ascend.', 'And thus, I see all this conference, you have our gratitude for being part of this, for being willing to receive these teachings, and have them projected to your auras and chakras into the collective consciousness, being willing to make these calls and invocations that have had a profound effect at this specific time, where so many questions are focused on the crucified Christ.', 'Rather than the resurrected Christ.', 'So, with this, with our profound gratitude, I seal you in the infinite unconditional, indescribable peace of the Buddha.']\n",
